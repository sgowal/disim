In this folder there is a Matlab script that can plot the data
gathered by the Disim simulator.

To use it, simply start Matlab and type:

> plot_recorded_data('my_speed_sensor.txt', 'v');
> plot_recorded_data('my_density_sensor.txt', 'k');
> plot_recorded_data('my_flow_sensor.txt', 'f');

Notice that the speed sensor also outputs the standard deviation
whereas the other ones do not (it makes no sense for them). This
allows one to convert between time mean speed (the one that is
logged) and space mean speed:

vs = vt/2 + sqrt(vt^2/4 - sigma_t^2)

The script can also be called with 's', to display the converted
space mean speed:

> plot_recorded_data('my_speed_sensor.txt', 's');
